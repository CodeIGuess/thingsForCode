# Everything for code.

This repository will just contain a few files for Code (I Guess),
Most of these will be javascript api's or text files storing data.

# Where else to write this?

I don't know where to write these ideas, so I'll just put them here. AI is now in the phase of machine learning, which takes many neurons and uses them for information, ultimately giving a result. Now, that works best for focused AI, that executes one task really well, but it doesn't work for more general AI.

For this I propose a different system, that has tons more capacity for general AI. The idea is taking a file (or files) of knowledge and feeding it into a machine learning program. The program would then expect an input (be it as a string or any type of file) and give off an answer with as much accuracy as possible. This AI would also be able to modify the files it takes for learning, which means it would also teach itself.

I'm not a professional programmer or anything, but with the experience I have, I can tell this might be helpful for some machine learning programs in the future.
